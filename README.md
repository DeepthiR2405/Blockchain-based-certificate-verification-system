# Blockchain-based-certificate-verification-system
This project is a decentralized web application (DApp) that allows institutions to issue tamper-proof digital certificates and enables real-time verification using blockchain technology. Built using Solidity, Web3.py, and Flask, it ensures security, transparency, and trust in academic and professional credentials.

🚀 Features
✅ Decentralized certificate issuance using Ethereum smart contracts

🛡️ Tamper-proof and immutable verification process

🔍 Real-time certificate lookup via transaction hash or wallet address

👤 User-friendly interface for institutions and verifiers

📃 Automates certificate generation and stores metadata securely on-chain

🛠️ Tech Stack
Smart Contract: Solidity (Deployed on local/testnet using Ganache or Infura)

Backend: Python, Flask, Web3.py

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Blockchain Interaction: MetaMask, Web3.js

Storage (Optional): IPFS (for large certificate files or PDFs)

📌 Use Case
This system can be used by universities, training centers, or certifying bodies to:

Eliminate fake certificates

Enable instant verification without intermediaries

Maintain a transparent academic record on blockchain

🧪 Future Improvements
Add role-based access (Admin, Student, Verifier)

Integrate IPFS for certificate file storage

Deploy to a public Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia)
